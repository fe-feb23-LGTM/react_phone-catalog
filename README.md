Hi!

We made this web page that enables users to choose a phone, customize its color, capacity, and other specifications. Additionally, users can add phones to their favorites or cart. For this project, we utilized React, CSS3, Bulma, React libraries, APIs, SASS, Node.js, AWS, PostgreSQL, Express, and CORS.

Also we used render.com as a server for our project. For first visiting our project it's can take up to 10 minutes to start a server.
